This repository was created to publish my first-ever attempt to build a Machine learning algorithm, train it on a huge dataset and make it work.

This repo consists of a CNN-based U-net architecture-based model built with the help of publicly available free resources such as Kaggle, Google Colab, and LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini. I also tried generating bits of code with the help of LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini.

Plans are to introduce YOLOv5 to the existing model to increase the accuracy of the model and also to minimise the training time, training size and resources.
